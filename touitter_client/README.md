# tOUItter

Shippio's technical assignment.
This is the client-side. Please head over [here](https://github.com/Steppico/touitter_server/tree/master/server) for the server side.

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

## How to start

The page will load at http://localhost:8081.

### NB It will work only if running the backend at the same time.

Also: the mailer service will work only setting an ENV file, on the server side, to sendgrid's user and password.
Please check the email sent you to have them.

First things first, it is necessary to sign up.
After confirming it, the backend will send an email to the address. In order to access, it is needed to check the email and click the required link.
Once done, it is possible to login and enjoy tOUItter.

There will be no tweet, at the beginning. To generate them, just input anything in the text box in the middle of the page.
To experience tOUItter at its best, a second user would be best.
